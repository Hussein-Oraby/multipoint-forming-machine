This machine is used to generate three-dimensional curves through a set of points fixed on a flexible surface. The coordinates of these points are controlled by linear actuators to give the required curve shape. Then comes the robot arm to print the appropriate building materials. These curves are then used in building facades
. The goal of this machine is to provide thousands of molds used in casting these curved shapes, thus saving time, effort and cost
